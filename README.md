# XMLRPC-Starter-Kit-for-iOS-Wordpress
A simple project to help you learn the basics of XMLRPC calls for iOS (iPhone and iPad) into a Wordpress install

Once you download this app, simply add your Wordpress URL, username, and password into the variables at the top of XmlRpcStarterKitViewController.m and launch the app.

I reccomend you create a new user just for usage from your iOS app so your main Wordpress credentials are not passed since it is not sent over SSL. If your Wordpress site supports SSL, thats all the better, and reccomended in a production environment.

Updated the project against XCode 7.1.1 and Wordpress 4.3.1.

Feel free to make any suggestions for future features and updates.

Hope this helps!
